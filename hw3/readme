3.3 Part B, ten most likely words to follow "THE".
"THE" is at index 3 of the file
THE
Count of THE is : 3855375
1 : the vocabulary is <UNK>
the bigram probability 0.61501981000551

2 : the vocabulary is U.
the bigram probability 0.01337249943261

3 : the vocabulary is FIRST
the bigram probability 0.01172026067503

4 : the vocabulary is COMPANY

3.3 Part c, comparing Log-likelihood of unigram and bigram
The unigram Log-likelihood is -64.50944034364879
The bigram Log-likelihood is -40.91813213378977

Therefore, the bigram model yields the highest log-likelihood

3.3 Part d, pair that are not observed
The unigram Log-likelihood is -44.29193447313260


not observed in training corpus: curr: OFFICIALS, previous SIXTEEN
not observed in training corpus: curr: FIRE, previous SOLD
Some Pairs are not find in traning corpus, which means the bigram 
probability is 0. And log(0) is undefined. Therefore, we can't calculate 
bigram log-likelihood for this sentence
